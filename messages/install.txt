Molokai-Pastel
==============

This is an attempt at providing the Sublime Text users the popular Molokai vim theme and also making my own twist to it.

Features:
---------
* at the time of writing, supports more syntax and plugins than other Molokai ports
  (Only for Molokai-Pastel.tmTheme)
* Desaturated colors based on the Molokai scheme for a less aggressive color contrast

Notes:
------
* Molokai.tmTheme is provided as a reference only, and is not
  actively maintained nor including all features.
