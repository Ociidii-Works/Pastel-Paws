#  Thank you for using Molokai-Pastel!  #

This is Molokai-Pastel v0.1.2!

Molokai-Legacy is currently the only scheme.
Once it becomes more mature, Pastel will follow. :)


Changelog:

### 0.1.2
Legacy:	Actual molokai colors. Needs more testing, but usable.	
Bugs/complaints: => https://github.com/Voaxeyr/Molokai-Pastel/issues

Pastel: Waiting for Monokai-Legacy to be polished.

### 0.1.1
learning this thing, looks like something

### 0.1.0
Birth.
The plan is: Two color schemes;
	* Molokai-Legacy: The vim Molokai theme. Minor edits to support more highlighting since Sublime can do it.
	* Molokai-Pastel: A more "PastelColor" version of molokai.
