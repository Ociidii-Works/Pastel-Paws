## Pastel Paws

A colorful theme with many, many definitions.

###Features:

* Supports more syntax and plugins than many color schemes. (at the time of writing)
* Originally based on Monokai/Molokai, it evolved into something unique.
* [Spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) support with `Pastel Paws - Spacegray.tmTheme`

This theme was tested in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) and [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com/3).

###Bleeding edge?

You can add this repository to package control to avoid waiting for releases and always be up-to-date, using [this method](http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/08/install-sublime-packages-from-github.html).
