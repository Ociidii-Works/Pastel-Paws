## Pastel Paws

A colorful theme with many, many definitions.

###Features:

* Supports more syntax and plugins than many color schemes. (at the time of writing)
* Originally based on Monokai/Molokai, it evolved into something unique.

This theme was tested in [Sublime Text 2][3] and [Sublime Text 3][4].

###Bleeding edge?

You can add this repository to package control to avoid waiting for releases and always be up-to-date, using [this method][5].
