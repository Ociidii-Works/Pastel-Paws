## Molokai-Pastel

This is an attempt at providing the Sublime Text users the popular [Molokai][4] vim  theme and also making my own twist to it. (The Pastel part is currently delayed until I finish the Legacy scheme.)

###Features:

* at the time of writing, supports more syntax and plugins than other Molokai ports
  (Only for Molokai-Pastel.tmTheme)
* Desaturated colors based on the Molokai scheme for a less aggressive color contrast

######Notes:
* Molokai.tmTheme is provided as a reference only, and is not
  actively maintained nor including all features.

###Isn't there a theme that looks (almost) the same called "Monokai"?:

Okay, people confuses **Molokai** and **Monokai** a lot. And that's perfectly understandable.

#####Here's the story:

This might get confusing a bit, but try to follow me here:
[TextMate][1] _(and by extension, [Sublime Text][2])_ has a color scheme called [Monokai][3], created by Wimer Hazenberg.

[Hamish Macpherson][5] made a modification of it, but wasn't released to the public.
However, based on his screenshots, [Tomas Restrepo][6] [ported it][9]
to the **vim** text editor.

[A colleague][7] made me discover Molokai in 2013 and I wanted to try it. Unfortunately, there was no Molokai (at least not under that name) for Sublime Text.

I decided to rebuild it for my personal use and I ended up providing the results to the Sublime Text Community. :)

__Note__: This theme was tested in [Sublime Text 2][2] and [Sublime Text 3][8].


### Bleeding edge?

You can tell package control to download Molokai-Pastel directly from this repo instead of waiting for releases, if you desire so.
To do that, follow [this method][10].
